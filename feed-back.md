## Frontend:

- Your use of Next.js is appreciated, but the frontend code needs improvement. It has a lot of state management and async use effects, and lacks early returns in components.
- While you have included type definitions, typing actions as `any` reduces the benefit of TypeScript.
- The overall architecture is clean, but the implementation appears rushed.

## Backend:

- The code in general looks good, and we appreciate the separation between business logic and data access layers.
- Input validation for APIs is missing, which is essential for robust data handling.
- There is no use of transactions for multiple database operations, which could lead to data inconsistencies.
- The database connection management using global variables is not ideal. A singleton class for the MongoDB database and for each repository would be more appropriate.
- Error handling and status code management are well done.

## General:

- Documentation is sparse and lacks explanations for major and minor decisions. We understand that the timeframe to complete the task was rather short, however it needs to be clearly stated where and why a shortcut was taken.
- Code contains global variables and misuses "use client," indicating a lack of understanding of the tools in use.
- The Docker setup is local-only, whereas deploying on Vercel could have been a quick alternative.
- The overall presentation does not meet our standards and raises concerns about code quality in a real-world scenario.
